      "headline": "African Super-App Gozem officially lands in Brazzaville 🎉",
      "preview": "Gozem expands into Central Africa, offering ride-hailing, delivery, and financial services via one app in Brazzaville.",
      "fullStory": "The Francophone Africa “super-app” Gozem has officially launched its operations in Brazzaville (Republic of the Congo) as of 6 November 2025, marking a major step in its regional expansion. The move furthers Gozem’s mission to bundle ride-hailing, delivery, and financial services under one roof – all tailored for African users.<br><br>For Brazzaville residents, this means you can now book standard taxis, ride in air-conditioned comfort options, or hire by the hour for errands or business trips — all via the Gozem app. Drivers (dubbed “Champions”) are also being onboarded, giving local earners new opportunities via this digital platform. Gozem says it already has more than 2 million users and over 30 million trips completed in its footprint.<br><br>What makes this rollout noteworthy:<br>- It shows African-founded tech scaling regionally — beyond West Africa into Central Africa.<br>- It strengthens the “super-app” play in Africa: one app, multiple services.<br>- It gives Brazzaville a shot at improved mobility options just as digital infrastructure is expanding across the country.<br><br>But it’s not all plug-and-play. Gozem’s challenge will be localizing: adjusting to Brazzaville’s transport regulations, language/market specifics, driver onboarding, payments infrastructure, and competition. If it nails those, it could become a serious player in Central African mobility and digital services.",
